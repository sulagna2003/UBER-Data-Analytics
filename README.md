# Uber Data Analysis:
This Uber Data Analysis project aims to provide insights into ride-sharing usage patterns by analyzing trip data. The primary objectives are to distinguish trips based on their purpose (business or personal), examine the geographical patterns of start and stop locations, and conduct a time series analysis to observe trends
over time.

## Overview
This project involves analyzing Uber trip data to uncover patterns and insights regarding trip purposes, geographical trends, and temporal dynamics. The primary goals are to distinguish between business and personal trips, map out start and stop locations, and perform a time series analysis to understand usage trends over time.

## Motivation
